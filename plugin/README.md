## Installation

### Method 1: Auto-Install (Recommended)

1. Install the plugin automatically using the Roblox Plugin Marketplace: https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/79510309341601/Azul-Companion-Plugin

> If the plugin does not show up, follow the [troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting).

### Method 2: Manual Install via Place File

1. Download the source code from the [Azul Companion Plugin](https://www.roblox.com/games/132762411481199/Azul-Companion-Plugin) place: (3 dots (⋯) > "Download")
2. Open the downloaded `.rbxlx` or `.rbxl` file in Roblox Studio
3. Right-click the `AzulPlugin` folder in `ServerStorage` and select **"Save as Local Plugin"**
4. Restart Roblox Studio
5. The Azul icon should now appear in the toolbar

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not showing up

Roblox is very particular about how plugins are installed. Sometimes, just "getting" the plugin from the marketplace isn't enough. Try the following steps:

1. Restart Roblox Studio
2. Open any game (or create a new one)
3. Go to **Toolbox** > **Inventory**<br/>
   ![alt text](../docs/assets/plugin/toolbox.png)
4. In the dropdown, select **My Plugins**
5. Locate the Azul Companion Plugin and click **Install**
6. The Azul icon should now appear in the toolbar

### Plugin not connecting

- Ensure the daemon is running (run `azul`)
- Check that `HttpService` is enabled:
  - Go to **Home** → **Game Settings** → **Security**
  - Enable **"Allow HTTP Requests"**
- Verify firewall isn't blocking port 8080

### Scripts not syncing

- Click "Toggle Sync" to reconnect
- Check the Output window for error messages
- Restart both the daemon and Studio

### Clearing Legacy GUIDs

Ever since Azul 1.0.5, the plugin uses a new method to identify projects. It is highly advised to clear any legacy GUIDs to avoid conflicts since they are no longer needed and consume unnecessary resources.

You can do so by clicking the "Clear Legacy GUIDs" button in the plugin settings. This will remove all old GUIDs stored in your Explorer.
